## Status

Complete.

## Reflection

My goal with this project was to learn how to use JavaScript on the backend. It was a great gateway into learning the MERN stack in small steps. It was interesting using EJS to serve the HTML from the app hosted on Heroku, without the need for a frontend. This meant that it was a very pure way to learn RESTful routing techniques, with all the logic handled with Express.

This was also my first foray into communicating with a database and handling user accounts. It was really interesting dealing with security for user logins using middleware and data validation for the RESTful API.
